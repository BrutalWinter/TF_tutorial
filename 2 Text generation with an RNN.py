########################           The prediction task
# 1. Given a character, or a sequence of characters, what is the most probable next character?
# This is the task you're training the model to perform. The input to the model will be a sequence of characters,
# and you train the model to predict the outputâ€”the following character at each time step.

# 2. Since RNNs maintain an internal state that depends on the previously seen elements,  given all the characters computed until this moment, what is the next character?

# 3. Create training examples and targets:
# Next divide the text into example sequences. Each input sequence will contain seq_length characters from the text.
# For each input sequence, the corresponding targets contain the same length of text, except shifted one character to the right.
# So break the text into chunks of seq_length+1. For example, say seq_length is 4 and our text is "Hello". The input sequence would be "Hell", and the target sequence "ello".
# To do this first use the tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices function to convert the text vector into a stream of character indices.

# The maximum length sentence you want for a single input in characters
seq_length = 100
examples_per_epoch = len(text)//(seq_length+1)

# For the input at time step 0, the model receives the index for "F" and tries to predict the index for "i" as the next character.
# At the next timestep, it does the same thing but the RNN considers the previous step context in addition to the current input character.
