#   This notebook trains a sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative, based on the text of the review.
# This is an example of binary—or two-class—classification, an important and widely applicable kind of machine learning problem.
# You'll use the Large Movie Review Dataset that contains the text of 50,000 movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database.
# These are split into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing. The training and testing sets are balanced,
# meaning they contain an equal number of positive and negative reviews.

# The aclImdb/train/pos and aclImdb/train/neg directories contain many text files, each of which is a single movie review. Let's take a look at one of them:
sample_file = os.path.join(train_dir, 'pos/1181_9.txt')
with open(sample_file) as f:
  print(f.read())

# Next, you will load the data off disk and prepare it into a format suitable for training. To do so, you will use the helpful
# text_dataset_from_directory utility, which expects a directory structure as follows.
# main_directory/class_a/a_text_1.txt, main_directory/class_a/a_text_2.txt
# main_directory/class_b/b_text_1.txt, main_directory/class_b/b_text_2.txt

# To prepare a dataset for binary classification, you will need two folders on disk, corresponding to class_a and class_b.
# These will be the positive and negative movie reviews, which can be found in aclImdb/train/pos and aclImdb/train/neg.
# As the IMDB dataset contains additional folders, you will remove them before using this utility.
remove_dir = os.path.join(train_dir, 'unsup')
shutil.rmtree(remove_dir)
# When running a machine learning experiment, it is a best practice to divide your dataset into three splits: train, validation, and test.
# The IMDB dataset has already been divided into train and test, but it lacks a validation set.
# Let's create a validation set using an 80:20 split of the training data by using the validation_split argument below.
batch_size = 32
seed = 42

raw_train_ds = tf.keras.preprocessing.text_dataset_from_directory('aclImdb/train', batch_size=batch_size, validation_split=0.2,subset='training', seed=seed)

# As you can see above, there are 25,000 examples in the training folder, of which you will use 80% (or 20,000) for training.
# As you will see in a moment, you can train a model by passing a dataset directly to model.fit.
# If you're new to tf.data, you can also iterate over the dataset and print out a few examples as follows:
for text_batch, label_batch in raw_train_ds.take(1):
  for i in range(5):
    print("Review", text_batch.numpy()[i])
    print("Label", label_batch.numpy()[i])

# Notice the reviews contain raw text (with punctuation and occasional HTML tags like <br/>). You will show how to handle these in the following section.
# The labels are 0 or 1. To see which of these correspond to positive and negative movie reviews, you can check the class_names property on the dataset.
print("Label 0 corresponds to", raw_train_ds.class_names[0])
print("Label 1 corresponds to", raw_train_ds.class_names[1])

# Next, you will create a validation and test dataset. You will use the remaining 5,000 reviews from the training set for validation.
raw_val_ds = tf.keras.preprocessing.text_dataset_from_directory('aclImdb/train', batch_size=batch_size, validation_split=0.2, subset='validation', seed=seed)
raw_test_ds = tf.keras.preprocessing.text_dataset_from_directory('aclImdb/test', batch_size=batch_size)

##############################    Prepare the dataset for training  ##############################
# Next, you will standardize, tokenize, and vectorize the data using the helpful preprocessing.TextVectorization layer.
# Standardization refers to preprocessing the text, typically to remove punctuation or HTML elements to simplify the dataset.
# Tokenization refers to splitting strings into tokens (for example, splitting a sentence into individual words, by splitting on whitespace).
# Vectorization refers to converting tokens into numbers so they can be fed into a neural network. All of these tasks can be accomplished with this layer.

# As you saw above, the reviews contain various HTML tags like <br />. These tags will not be removed by the default standardizer
# in the TextVectorization layer (which converts text to lowecase and strips punctuation by default, but doesn't strip HTML).
# You will write a custom standardization function to remove the HTML.

def custom_standardization(input_data):
  lowercase = tf.strings.lower(input_data)
  stripped_html = tf.strings.regex_replace(lowercase, '<br />', ' ')
  return tf.strings.regex_replace(stripped_html,'[%s]' % re.escape(string.punctuation), '')

# Next, you will create a TextVectorization layer. you will use this layer to standardize, tokenize, and vectorize our data.
# You set the output_mode to int to create unique integer indices for each token.
# Note that you're using the default split function, and the custom standardization function you defined above.
# You'll also define some constants for the model, like an explicit maximum sequence_length, which will cause the layer to pad or truncate sequences to exactly sequence_length values.
max_features = 10000
sequence_length = 250

vectorize_layer = TextVectorization(standardize=custom_standardization,max_tokens=max_features,output_mode='int',output_sequence_length=sequence_length)
# Next, you will call adapt to fit the state of the preprocessing layer to the dataset. This will cause the model to build an index of strings to integers.
# Note: it's important to only use your training data when calling adapt (using the test set would leak information)
# Make a text-only dataset (without labels), then call adapt
train_text = raw_train_ds.map(lambda x, y: x)
vectorize_layer.adapt(train_text)

# Let's create a function to see the result of using this layer to preprocess some data.
def vectorize_text(text, label):
  text = tf.expand_dims(text, -1)
  return vectorize_layer(text), label

# retrieve a batch (of 32 reviews and labels) from the dataset
text_batch, label_batch = next(iter(raw_train_ds))
first_review, first_label = text_batch[0], label_batch[0]
print("Review", first_review)
print("Label", raw_train_ds.class_names[first_label])
print("Vectorized review", vectorize_text(first_review, first_label))

# As you can see above, each token has been replaced by an integer. You can lookup the token (string) that each integer corresponds to by calling
# .get_vocabulary() on the layer.
print("1287 ---> ",vectorize_layer.get_vocabulary()[1287])
print(" 313 ---> ",vectorize_layer.get_vocabulary()[313])

##############################    Configure the dataset for performance  ##############################
# .cache(): keeps data in memory after it's loaded off disk.
# This will ensure the dataset does not become a bottleneck while training your model.
# If your dataset is too large to fit into memory, you can also use this method to create a performant on-disk cache,
# which is more efficient to read than many small files.
# Note: cache will produce exactly the same elements during each iteration through the dataset.
# If you wish to randomize the iteration order, make sure to call shuffle after calling cache.
# .prefetch() overlaps data preprocessing and model execution while training.

###########    Create the model
# The layers are stacked sequentially to build the classifier:
#   1. The first layer is an Embedding layer. This layer takes the integer-encoded reviews and looks up an embedding vector for each word-index.
# These vectors are learned as the model trains. The vectors add a dimension to the output array. The resulting dimensions are: (batch, sequence, embedding).
#   2. a GlobalAveragePooling1D layer returns a fixed-length output vector for each example by averaging over the sequence dimension.
# This allows the model to handle input of variable length, in the simplest way possible.
#   3. This fixed-length output vector is piped through a fully-connected (Dense) layer with 16 hidden units. The last layer is densely connected with a single output node.

# If you want to make your model capable of processing raw strings (for example, to simplify deploying it),
# you can include the TextVectorization layer inside your model. To do so, you can create a new model using the weights you just trained.

# To get predictions for new examples, you can simply call model.predict().

#Including the text preprocessing logic inside your model enables you to export a model for production that simplifies deployment,
# and reduces the potential for train/test skew.

# There is a performance difference to keep in mind when choosing where to apply your TextVectorization layer.
# Using it outside of your model enables you to do asynchronous CPU processing and buffering of your data when training on GPU.
# So, if you're training your model on the GPU, you probably want to go with this option to get the best performance while developing your model,
# then switch to including the TextVectorization layer inside your model when you're ready to prepare for deployment.
